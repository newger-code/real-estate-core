# ✅ Indentation Fix Complete - Success Report

**Date:** 2025-09-17
**Time:** 20:10 UTC
**Status:** SUCCESSFUL

## Problem Solved:
✅ **Fixed:** Multiple class methods were defined at global scope instead of class scope
✅ **Fixed:** `AttributeError: 'PropertyScraper' object has no attribute 'run'`
✅ **Fixed:** All methods now properly belong to PropertyScraper class

## Files Organized:
- ✅ **Main File:** `/scrape_property.py` - Clean, working version
- ✅ **Backups:** Moved to `/test_claude/` directory
- ✅ **Test Files:** Organized in `/test_claude/`
- ✅ **Screenshots:** Auto-organized in `/screenshots/` with timestamps

## Changes Made:
**All methods now properly indented as class methods:**
- ✅ `async def scrape_homes_com(self, page):` - Fixed (4 spaces)
- ✅ `async def extract_homes_property_data(self, page):` - Fixed (4 spaces)
- ✅ `async def scrape_redfin(self, page):` - Fixed (4 spaces)
- ✅ `async def extract_redfin_property_data(self, page):` - Fixed (4 spaces)
- ✅ `async def run(self):` - Fixed (4 spaces)

**All functionality preserved:**
- ✅ Firefox browser engine (your improvement)
- ✅ Direct search URL approach (your improvement)
- ✅ Human-like behaviors (scrolling, mouse movement - your improvement)
- ✅ Proxy authentication (working config)
- ✅ SSL certificate handling
- ✅ Screenshot organization

## Testing Results:
```
✅ Methods available: ['run', 'scrape_homes_com', 'scrape_redfin']
✅ Class instantiation: SUCCESS
✅ Environment variables: Loaded correctly
✅ Certificate: Found and configured
✅ Proxy credentials: Configured and working
```

## Ready for Production Test:
The scraper is now structurally sound and ready for testing:
```bash
python scrape_property.py '1240 Pondview Ave, Akron, OH 44305' homes
```

**Previous Issue:** `AttributeError: 'PropertyScraper' object has no attribute 'run'`
**Current Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - All methods accessible

Your strategic improvements (Firefox, direct URLs, human behaviors) are all intact and ready to test against the bot detection systems.
